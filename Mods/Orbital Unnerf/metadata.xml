    <description>Unnerfs orbitals that got nerfed in repantance
-Increases hitbox size for all orbitals to 13 (In AB+ all orbitals I tested had a hitbox size of 13 let me know if there are any exceptions I need to add)
-double orbital contact damage to compensate for the slower contact damage tick rate (can't change that directly as far as I know)</description>
